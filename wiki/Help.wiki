===Using external codecs===
Although ffmpeg is a so powerful codecs package, sometimes it can't do it right for some codec, such as Real Codecs. MPlayerX could take advantage of external codecs, but it needs some work.
  #. open Terminal in /Applications/Utilities/
  #. cd ~/Library/Preferences/
  #. type  *{{{defaults write org.niltsh.MPlayerX Prefer64bitMPlayer 0}}}*
    this hidden setting will force MPlayerX to use the 32bit version of mplayer, whatever your Mac has a 64bit CPU or not.
  #. right-click MPlayerX > show Package Content, goto *Contents/Resources/binaries/m32/codecs*
  #. copy the codec binaries into *MPlayerX.app/Contents/Resources/binaries/m32/codecs/*
    (e.g Real Codec binaries in *{{{RealPlayer.app/Contents/Frameworks/HXClientKit.framework/HelixPlugins/Codecs/*.bundle}}}*)
