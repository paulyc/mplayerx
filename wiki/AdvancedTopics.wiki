==Using multi-touch==
      Now MplayerX supports magnify, swipe if your Mac supports Multi-Touch.

==Using multi-thread ffmpeg==
      Although this setting is disclosed in Preferences, I can't assure it will always perform right with this setting ON since ffmpeg-mt is still under intensive development. However certainly some HQ movies needs ffmpeg-mt, so please turn it on when you think you really need it.

==Using external codecs==
      Although ffmpeg is a so powerful codecs package, sometimes it can't do it right for some codec, such as Real Codecs. MplayerX could take advantage of external codecs, but it needs some work.
      #. open Terminal in /Applications/Utilities/
      #. cd ~/Library/Preferences/
      #. type  *{{{defaults write org.niltsh.MplayerX Prefer64bitMplayer 0}}}*
            this hidden setting will force MplayerX to use the 32bit version of mplayer, whatever your Mac has a 64bit CPU or not.
      #. right-click MplayerX > show Package Content, goto Contents/Resources/binaries/m32/codecs
      #. copy the codec binaries into MplayerX.app/Contents/Resources/binaries/m32/codecs/
            (e.g Real Codec binaries in RealPlayer.app/Contents/Frameworks/HXClientKit.framework/HelixPlugins/Codecs/{{{*}}}.bundle)
